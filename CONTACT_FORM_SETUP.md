# Contact Form Setup Guide

## ✅ GREAT NEWS: Your contact form is now configured with enhanced security!

Your contact form has been set up with Formspree and now includes Cloudflare Turnstile for spam protection.

## ✅ Current Setup
- **Formspree Form ID**: `mvgreroo`
- **Form URL**: https://formspree.io/f/mvgreroo
- **Environment file**: Created with your form ID
- **Integration**: ContactForm.tsx updated to use Formspree properly
- **🛡️ NEW: Cloudflare Turnstile**: Added for security and spam protection

## 🛡️ Security Features

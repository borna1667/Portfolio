# Cloudflare Turnstile Setup Guide

## ✅ TURNSTILE INTEGRATION COMPLETE!

Your contact form now includes Cloudflare Turnstile for enhanced security and spam protection.

## 🔐 How It Works

1. **User fills out the contact form** - Name, email, subject, and message
2. **User clicks "Send Message"** - Turnstile widget appears
3. **User completes security verification** - Cloudflare validates the user
4. **Form submits securely** - Message is sent with verification token

## 🚀 Setup for Production

### 1. Get Your Cloudflare Turnstile Site Key

1. Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. Navigate to **Turnstile** section
3. Click **Add Site**
4. Configure your site:
   - **Site Name**: Your Portfolio
   - **Domain**: `yourdomain.com` (or your deployment URL)
   - **Widget Mode**: Managed
5. Copy your **Site Key**

### 2. Environment Variables

For **local development**, the `.env` file is already configured with a test key:
```env
VITE_CLOUDFLARE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=1x00000000000000000000AA
```

For **production deployment**, update your environment variables:

#### DigitalOcean App Platform:
```env
VITE_FORMSPREE_FORM_ID=mvgreroo
VITE_CLOUDFLARE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=your_actual_site_key_here
```

#### Vercel/Netlify:
Add the same environment variables in your deployment settings.
